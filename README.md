2. Install Python from downloaded package.
(Alternatively, you can use desktop anaconda app for easier work with envs [Python 3, Anaconda, work with environments](https://www.continuum.io/blog/developer-blog/python-3-support-anaconda))
3. Clone the project, navigate to project directory from your terminal, run:
```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```
4. To run all the tests from terminal, inside the project, run ```behave features```. To launch 1 feature, run ```behave features/tests/<feature_name>.feature```


#### Behave
**features package** contains tests (feature file scenarios), steps, and environment.
- feature files contain test scenarios written as text with behave keywords
- test steps define scenario statements and translate English text to Python
- environment.py file links test steps to *app* package and defines set of methods to execute _before_ and _after_ every test
feature/scenario/step.

[Official documentation](https://behave.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) about BDD, keywords, and running behave scenarios.
